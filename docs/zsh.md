intro: |
[zsh][] is a very advanced and programmable command interpreter.
---

Getting Started
---------------
### 1. Requirements
- [zsh][] - command interpreter.
- [zplugin][] - plugin manager for zsh.
- [fzf][] - general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.
- [fzy][] - fuzzy text selector finder for the terminal.
- [yay][] - an AUR helper written in Go.

### 2. Install Zplugin
```bash
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdharma/zplugin/master/doc/install.sh)"
$ zplugin self-update
```

### 3. Install FZF
```bash
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf
```
Obs.: needs to install [`ripgrep`][] for my personal settings.
